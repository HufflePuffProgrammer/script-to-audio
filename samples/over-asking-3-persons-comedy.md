INT. DIGITAL BRAND EMPIRE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

THE TIKTOK LOGO ends the TikTok post. Brand Strategists 
ZEEK, 24, and ASHLEY, 25, gather their thoughts, having 
seen the visuals that accompany the voiceover we heard. 
Across the table, MARGO PRETTY, 33, awaits their 
reaction. The star of the TikTok has spent her life 
effortlessly cashing-in her winnings from the genetic 
lottery, but presenting the intellectual artistry 
swirling inside her brain is terrifying. She pulls a 
notepad from a designer tote to hide her nerves.

ASHLEY
That’s not actually your 
personality, right?
MARGO
The voiceover? No, I’m acting. 
Happy.
ZEEK
Maybe it grates a little?
They are annoyingly self-assured for being so young 
because they actually know what they’re talking about.
MARGO
I can re-dub it. I just figured 
lifestyle brands would want 
someone cheery --
ZEEK
It’s fine. 
His words hang there, until she finally fills the air.
MARGO

Anyway, I was thinking athleisure, 
supplements, Tonal, Vitamix --
ZEEK
The prescriptive lifestyle space 
if very full. And we’ve found that 
it’s less successful when 
influencers look --
ASHLEY
Like you.
Margo has no idea what that means.
ZEEK
It plays sad.
ASHLEY

3.
Skinny jeans sad.
MARGO
Okay...
ZEEK
The public likes a story. Fat-to
fit. Fit-to-fat. Fat-to-fit-back- 
to-fat. 
ASHLEY
Unfortunately, you were born 
holding a winning lottery ticket.  
MARGO
Actually, I was a preemie with 
hypoglycemia --
ZEEK
What  Ashley means, and I’m so not 
putting words in your mouth --
ASHLEY
No, please, you’re fine --
ZEEK
The trifecta of thin, skin, and 
good hair is neither aspirational 
nor horrifying. It’s --
ASHLEY
Irksome.
